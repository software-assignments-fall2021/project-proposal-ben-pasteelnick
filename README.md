# Project Proposal

### Project title
All In Poker

### What and why?
I would like to build a platform on which casual poker players can freely play poker with friends, strangers, or against automated opponents. These would be exclusive to casual, non-gambling games, and there would be no monetization or any monetary value to the chips. Currently, the existing platforms for casual poker either don't allow for online play, or feature some form of monetization. This platform would allow users to simply play poker for the love of the game without having to deal with the hassle of the monetary aspects.

### For whom?
This software would be for me and my friends, and people like us. Especially during the pandemic, we especially noticed the lack of a straightforward platform on which to play poker, one that did not involve monetization.

### How?
This system would likely be a web based application where users could play poker in browser. They'd log in to a website and be able to either create or join a lobby with other players. Unfilled seats could be filled with AI opponents with variable skill levels. The parameters of the game itself such as amount of chips and blind sizes would be defined by the lobby host, and then all the players in the lobby would be able to play against one another using a simulated deck of cards.

### Scope
Most of the basic framework would be rather straightforward: setting up the platform and allowing people to connect to it, and establishing the game's framework, while not trivial, does seem rather simple. The features following that, though, which would be perfecting the GUI and the AI opponents, have rather variable difficulty. A significant amount of work could be poured into each of these elements while still leaving room for improvement. Because this project has a reasonably accomplishable base condition but a lot of room for effort to be put in to achieve results, I believe it is solidly within the scope of this course.
